Hi,

The PHP codes have been shortened for easier understanding and learning.
 Additionally, the code has been tested.

Changes in Code:
- Concatenation has been integrated directly instead of using separate concatenation.
- The ternary operator has been used instead of if-else statements.
- Repeated code has been eliminated.
- CSS is optional; the code functions properly without it.
- The <html> and <body> tags in PHP are optional.
- Conditions have been added to prevent errors, for example: echo $variable ?? '';
- Server connection variables are integrated to mysqli() function directly.
